## Overview

A Protocol Design App is currently developed to operate an open-source and modular workstation. The GUI guides the user through the experimental parameter selection and
generates a ready-to-use protocol code to operate the workstation.

Specifically, the Protocol Design App provides the following features:

 * Designed for hydrogel mixing tasks
 * Open-source
 * Guided workflow to select parameters
 * Integrated tip immersion optimization

The documentation is still in work and will be updated soon.
